# WHY THIS EXISTS. run-agent.sh survives a lot on its own: it waits out usage limits, retries
# transient API failures without spending a nudge, and resumes after every clean stop until its
# nudge budget runs out. But when that budget IS spent, or the script itself dies, the machine goes
# idle until a human notices. Observed: a five-hour idle stretch overnight because four nudges were
# burned on an API outage. This closes that hole — nothing here needs an interactive session, a
# terminal, or an assistant to be listening.
#
# It deliberately does NOT pass RESUME_NOTE. The note carries one-off direction ("do these two
# first"); re-issuing it on every relaunch for hours would keep pointing the agent at work it has
# already finished. A plain resume tells it to continue where it left off, which is what is wanted.
