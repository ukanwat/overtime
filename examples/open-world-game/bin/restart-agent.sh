# The supervisor treats a missing lock as a dead runner, so clearing the lock by hand is
# indistinguishable from a crash and it will launch its own runner. That produced two agents on one
# editor. This holds the supervisor off, stops the old runner, verifies it is really gone, starts the
# new one, then releases the supervisor.
